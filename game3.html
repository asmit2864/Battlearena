                <p>PUBG is a battle royale game where players parachute onto an island, scavenge for weapons and equipment, and compete to be the last one standing. In our tournaments, teams or individual players face off against each other in a variety of settings, utilizing tactics, strategy, and skill to survive and emerge victorious. Matches are dynamic and unpredictable, requiring adaptability and cunning to succeed.</p>
